    What my inefficiency taught me 

    So I had a lot of things to do, I decided to make some time free to work on those things 


    First I wanted to start early, so when my alarm started ringing I knew I had time to turn around and sleep an extra hour 


    After I had my shower and breakfast, that took me 2 hours, I went to my home office, where I started to watch my wedding video before this also took me another hour. 

    That give me a lot of positive energy, but it took my precious time. 


    Well it was time to make a To Do list. 

    I always use my Planner

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
